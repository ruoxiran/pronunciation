<h1>W3C Pronunciation Task Force SSML in HTML Sample Content</h1>
<p>This sample content has been developed by the W3C Accessible Platform Architecture Pronunciation Task Force to allow developers to
evaluate and test their implementation of the proposed Attribute Model of SSML in HTML. The samples are presented in each of the two proposed
approaches for representing  SSML via attibutes.  There are currently 9 test cases, each incorporating
one or more of the SSML functions defined in the Pronunciation Technical Approach Document. Each test case includes an audio sample of the expected
spoken presentation.
</p>
<p>Developers of read aloud tools, screen readers, and voice assistants should use these test cases to evaluate and test their implementation. Questions and test results
should be filed as issues in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation">Pronunciation github repo</a>.</p>
